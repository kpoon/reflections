When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working with other people.  Or need to access the code from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you donâ€™t want it to override the changes you made locally.
